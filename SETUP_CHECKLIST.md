## 🔧 Optional: Enable Cloudflare AI (For Better LLM Responses)

**Current Status:** Working with keyword matching fallback
**Benefit:** Adds real AI understanding with Llama 3.1 8B model

### Steps:

1. **Create Cloudflare Account (Free)**
   - Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
   - Sign up for free account
   - Free tier: 10,000 AI requests/day

2. **Get Credentials**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Navigate to "Workers & Pages"
   - Click on "AI" section
   - Copy your **Account ID**
   - Create an **API Token**:
     - Click "Create Token"
     - Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
     - Or create custom token with "Workers AI" permissions

3. **Add to Supabase Edge Function**
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to "Edge Functions"
   - Click on "ai-guidance" function
   - Add these secrets:
     ```
     CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
     CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
     ```

4. **Test It**
   - Restart your app
   - Try: "My father was detained by immigration"
   - Should get empathetic AI response instead of generic message

**Note:** The app works perfectly without Cloudflare AI - it uses intelligent keyword matching as fallback!

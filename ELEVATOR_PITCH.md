# Civic Aid - Elevator Pitch

## The 30-Second Pitch

**Civic Aid is a multilingual crisis guidance platform that gives immigrants, visa holders, and families immediate, actionable help during their most vulnerable moments—from ICE detention to visa emergencies—in 10 languages, powered by AI, and accessible to everyone, anywhere, for free.**

---

## The Problem (The Crisis)

Every day in America:
- **500+ people** are detained by ICE, often with families left in the dark
- **1.2 million** visa holders face expiration deadlines with unclear guidance
- **Millions** of immigrants speak limited English and can't navigate complex legal systems
- **Federal employees** face sudden shutdowns with no financial safety net
- **Legal resources** are expensive, hard to find, and often unavailable when needed most

**The stakes are life-changing**: deportation, family separation, lost jobs, expired status, and crushing legal fees.

**The gap**: When crisis strikes at 2 AM, there's nowhere to turn. Government websites are confusing. Lawyers are expensive. Language barriers are insurmountable. Time is running out.
